flvideoreplacer
===============

FlashVideoReplacer is an extension that allows to replace embedded flash videos and display them with a different plugin
or standalone player, download or automatically redirect to WebM player when available. This version is a fork from 
https://github.com/webgapps/flvideoreplacer/downloads which is updated to work again with the original sites.

2013/01/11: All supportes sites from the original are working again in linux and Windows.
